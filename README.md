# FancyCar
This project is a C++ simulation I created to model a car's basic functionality using object-oriented programming principles. The core of the project is the FancyCar class, which handles various real-world behaviors of a car, like starting the engine, driving, and tracking fuel consumption. 

Here’s what the project demonstrates:

Engine Control: The car’s engine can be started and stopped, with safeguards that prevent actions like refueling while the engine is running.
Driving Functionality: I implemented logic to simulate driving, where the car’s mileage per gallon (MPG) determines how far it can travel before running out of gas. The system even tracks miles driven and handles scenarios like running out of fuel.
Odometer and Gas Gauge: The car keeps track of miles driven and the amount of gas left in the tank, which users can check at any point.
Fuel Management: The program allows users to refuel the car, with validation to prevent overfilling. The car can only be refueled when the engine is off.
Error Handling: I built in some basic error handling, like ensuring the car can’t drive without the engine being started and checking for valid fuel inputs.
This project highlights my understanding of constructors, class methods, and member variables, while applying OOP concepts to a practical simulation. It’s been a great way to reinforce C++ programming skills and apply them in a fun, real-world context.
